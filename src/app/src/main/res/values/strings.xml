        "This android application translates all or selected SMS from inbox in demand or automatically. User can choose to translate all or select messages to translate into desired language. The application usages google translator (API) to translate messages. As of now the application only works with internet (WIFI/Mobile data). In future ML model can be introduced for offline translation.\n\n"
